# mprado.ml
my personal website/blog (v2!) based on [the gatsby starter glass](https://github.com/yinkakun/gatsby-starter-glass) to replace my stupid [google sites version](https://www.mprado.ml/) as well as my current [gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/mapoztate/mprado.ml) when I get around to it??? 


## goals
* ~~first of all learn how to use this thing~~
* personalize this to my liking
* migrate all the content that is currently on mprado.ml to here
* then write more blogs, add more portfolio content
* new domain or transfer?

## inspo
* [vihan.org](https://vihan.org/)
* [j-fan.ml](https://j-fan.ml/)


and most importantly...
* [angelajt.com](http://angelajt.com/)
