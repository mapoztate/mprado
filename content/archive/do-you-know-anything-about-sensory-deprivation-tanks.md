Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit

Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
