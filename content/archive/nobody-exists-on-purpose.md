Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We're all going to die. Come watch TV. Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We're all going to die. Come watch TV. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?. Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan!! They're inside you building a monument to compromise!! Fuck them. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing Ethan.

I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?. Why are you fighting? Can’t you see you’re all the same? / Oh Summer, first race war, huh?. I wish that shotgun was my penis. You're missing the point Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No. I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live.

I wish that shotgun was my penis. He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. I wish that shotgun was my penis. It's like the N word and the C word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

All right, all right, cool it! I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be Grandpa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty, sit here. Summer, you sit here. Now, listen—I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways. What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. If it was, you could call me Ernest Hemingway. You're missing the point Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No. Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all, otherwise you’re just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.

Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit
transierant. Relicta significat rubenti potest.

Illa tibi cruentum adpulit pallent. Una dolorem quaque. Pars parvi, mihi quae
Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
