Why are you fighting? Can’t you see you’re all the same? / Oh Summer, first race war, huh?. Why are you fighting? Can’t you see you’re all the same? / Oh Summer, first race war, huh?. Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan!! They're inside you building a monument to compromise!! Fuck them. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing Ethan.

Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

You're young, you have your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut yet malleable. He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. Why are you fighting? Can’t you see you’re all the same? / Oh Summer, first race war, huh?. All right, all right, cool it! I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be Grandpa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty, sit here. Summer, you sit here. Now, listen—I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways. All right, all right, cool it! I see what's happening here.

Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit
transierant. Relicta significat rubenti potest.

Illa tibi cruentum adpulit pallent. Una dolorem quaque. Pars parvi, mihi quae
Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
