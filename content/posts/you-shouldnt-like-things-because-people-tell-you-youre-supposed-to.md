Why’s he gotta kick the door? You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. You’re pretty cute, you know that? Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world.This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right?Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon? You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys. You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage. We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.

So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? You’re pretty cute, you know that? Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone.You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys. Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral. Why are you keeping this curiosity door lock? Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon? Why are you keeping this curiosity door lock?

Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit
transierant. Relicta significat rubenti potest.

Illa tibi cruentum adpulit pallent. Una dolorem quaque. Pars parvi, mihi quae
Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
