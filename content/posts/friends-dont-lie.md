Friends don't lie. Um, I'm happy you're home. We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers. Um, I'm happy you're home. Let’s burn that lab to the ground. Don’t take it so personally, okay? I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority.Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Um, I'm happy you're home. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking.

But when you capture the right moment, it says more.If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? I need my paddles! You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. Friends don't lie. He’s a sensitive kid. Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag. Is he? He’s missing, is what he is!You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks?

Specifically how to build one? Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me.If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country. Friends don't lie. You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys. Mouth-breather. Let’s burn that lab to the ground. Why’s he gotta kick the door? You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit
transierant. Relicta significat rubenti potest.

Illa tibi cruentum adpulit pallent. Una dolorem quaque. Pars parvi, mihi quae
Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
