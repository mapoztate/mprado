I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?. Wow, I really Cronenberged up the whole place, huh Morty? Just a bunch a Cronenbergs walkin' around. I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?. If it was, you could call me Ernest Hemingway. You're missing the point Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.

I dunno, some people would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. Morty, do you know what “wubba lubba dub dub” means?. It's like the N word and the C word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan!! They're inside you building a monument to compromise!! Fuck them. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing Ethan. I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?.

I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?. Morty, do you know what “wubba lubba dub dub” means?. Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We're all going to die. Come watch TV. Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We're all going to die. Come watch TV. He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.

Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit
transierant. Relicta significat rubenti potest.

Illa tibi cruentum adpulit pallent. Una dolorem quaque. Pars parvi, mihi quae
Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
