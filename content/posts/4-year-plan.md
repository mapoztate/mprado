description: A plan that works for everyone toward making the best use of your time at high school.

### Freshman year - 
* GRADES ARE NOT ENOUGH.
    * The colleges understand the GPA system is very easy to game, so you’ll need to focus on shelling yourself out as an applicant in other ways.
    * Getting valedictorian does not guarantee you into a good school, but getting started early does.
* Get involved with all aspects of high school life (clubs, sports, etc.)
    * Document every activity you do.
    * Quality > quantity - try to make them impactful.
    * Have fun and create quality experiences (this will come useful later on writing college app essays).
* Try to explore passions outside of school.
* Get to know everyone (your counselor is a great start)
    * Being successful is more than just a numbers game. Having a good relationship with people can make for irreplaceable resources, indirectly influence your grade, and create additional opportunities.
    * Getting advice from your older peers all throughout high school is key.
* Even if you don’t know exactly what you want to do, try and make a 4 year plan to clear graduation and A-G requirements.
    * I cannot stress how much planning ahead helps - you’ll just need to follow it for the rest of your 3 years and can get into classes if you’re on top of it.
    * Not all A-G classes have to be taken at the high school. For example, the first semester of language at DVC will cover two years.
    * However, these classes will only go toward elective credit. You’ll still need core requirements such as 4 years of English and 3 years of math.
* Don’t waste your summers!
    * If there’s classes you want to get out of (ie: Precalculus), you can take them at an online high school or DVC in 6 weeks.
    * Doesn’t have to be super academic, even working on your hobbies is a good use of time.

### Sophomore year - 
* GRADES ARE NOT ENOUGH.
    * Same as above, but just need to drill it in their heads.
* Begin to make effective use of your time.
    * Find out what extracurricular activities really interest you and stick to those.
    * Balance your time spent of classes with extracurricular activities
* Start to increase your course rigor. (eg: AP Modern World)
    * There will be classes you don’t want to take, but they’re necessary for success.
    * If you know what you’re interested in, take classes applicable to that field.
    * If you don’t have enough class space, consider self-studying an AP exam.
* Prepare for SAT/ACT (good to have)
    * If you have to retake, do it three times at most before senior year.
* Look for summer programs that interest you and create a timeline for the remaining summers.

### Junior year - 
* GRADES ARE NOT ENOUGH.
    * Same as above, but just need to drill it in their heads.
* Take the highest rigor courses possible.
    * AP Bio, AP Chem, AP Lang, etc.
* Community college is your best friend.
    * Consider taking the CC courses the high school offers.
    * If there are courses that appeal to your passion and the school doesn’t offer them, take them.
    * There’s online classes which don’t have a specific time slot.
* Stay consistent with your EC activities.
* Consider a job/internship/research.
* Fully fill out the brag sheet - you’ll need it for Letters of Recommendation in college
    * Ask early - teachers will be slammed senior year with last minute LoRs, and you’ll want a quality paper.
    * Preferably junior year teachers, but anyone you’ve kept close with is good.
    * You’ll want at least one STEM and one Humanities teacher, and then preferably someone completely random for your supplementary.
* Start a list of scholarships and colleges based on your profile (GPA, test scores, demographic, campus, student life, etc.)
    * You should have three types of schools: reaches, targets, and safeties.

### Senior year - 
#### The summer before…
* Start drafting essays (PIQs are the same, Common App prompts open Aug. 1)
    * This is a whole game in itself - you should prepare well in advance.
* Tour the colleges, talk to alumni, and get a good sense of culture.
* Don’t have too many chefs in the kitchen regarding your college search strategy - you’ll want to keep consistent with the advice and pathway you follow.

#### Fall
* Maintain a good sense of course rigor, but it doesn’t need to be as hard as junior year. 
    * Treat college app & scholarship season as another class - it’ll take up the same amount of time, if not more.
* Keep doing what you’ve been doing the past 3 years, but don’t stress too much and enjoy your last year.
* Start the applications ASAP.
    * Fill out FAFSA (for financial aid) on Oct. 1.

#### Spring
* If you’re ready to accept a college’s offer, congrats!
    * Accept by May 1 & figure out the process of sending your high school (and possibly college transcripts) to the school.
* If you don’t get into the college of your dreams, it’s not the end of the world.
    * The stigma behind community colleges is a lie.
        * You save plenty of money and have time to figure out your major.
        * DVC gives you a second chance if high school didn’t work out too well.
        * DVC also has an 80% transfer rate into Berkeley among other top tier UCs.
        * The UCs only take into account things done in CC.
        * In some ways, it’s easier classes and easier to transfer.
    * In addition, some colleges accept on a rolling basis - meaning they accept applications any time of the year.
