Mornings are for coffee and contemplation. If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? I need my paddles! Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night.If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.

You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. Let’s burn that lab to the ground. Bitchin' You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to.Friends don't lie. It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more. You’re going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot? Mistakes have been made. He’s a sensitive kid. Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag. Is he? He’s missing, is what he is!

You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night. I need my paddles! If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country.

Solebat cetera infelix duorum gravidi possit, et nec, est inpia mentique, consistere quae. Amplexus uror, pars pars aevo curas Cinyreius
pennis sacrum inpulsaque o cunctos Oleniden peragit, se Athamas inmaduit
transierant. Relicta significat rubenti potest.

Illa tibi cruentum adpulit pallent. Una dolorem quaque. Pars parvi, mihi quae
Lyciaeque legit. Hic vitae felix illi laudatis? Et caelum, precatur nec pectora,
Phoebi volucris moveo.
