#### My Pursuits
1. Currently, I'm involved in the community through leading various STEM programs and employed to enrich the edtech field at a cybersecurity company.
2. During 7th grade, I established Valkyrie PCs, a small IT business dedicated toward to the local community through the art of building computers and keyboards as well as the traditional services that IT businesses offer.
3. Ever since the establishment of my small business, I've enjoyed the process of and have set my focuses on nonprofits as a part of my next plan.
4. I love venturing new things. I'm a person who dips into a bit of everything and goes down an inevitable rabbit hole of and time burning. If you think you have something that might pique my interest, please reach out!

#### Passion Projects
1. I learned how to program at 7 years old, and have been refining my craft ever since through freelance work. Programming allows me to visualize potential tangible products and create stupid ideas in my leisure. 
2. When I was 2 years old, I played World of Warcraft for the first time. Although I don't play anymore, I've ventured into other games such as Destiny and SWTOR. These games were the inspiration for everything I do today.
3. Alongside WoW, reading the dictionary and writing my thoughts taught me how to communicate my thoughts in English. I don't keep a journal, so writing these blogs serves you and me.
4. As a person born and raised in the Bay Area but heavily tied to my heritage, tradition, food, language, and travel are life-changing experiences that are priceless. Exposure to various cultures at a young age has created an appreciation to learn and dive into societies that I am not familiar in.

#### Future Goals
1. After I graduate high school and community college, my plan is to pursue Computer Science at a 4 year or continue my existing degrees if I land into a public institution. I will pursue postgraduate education.
2. Communicating my thoughts through the internet has served as a form of relaxant. Although no one may notice, I want to venture into streaming/media creation again and maybe start a podcast or newsletter.
3. On the side, I want to continue to make an impact in startup culture and nonprofit organizations. Who knows if I work with the next unicorn?
4. Dream school? Career? Where to live? Only time will tell.
