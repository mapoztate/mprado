<div class = "heading"> <h2>About Me</h2>

<br>
I'm a first-generation student and a part of UC Berkeley's Class of 2025, studying Data Science with an emphasis in Business Analytics. I've been interested in tech ever since I was young, and have over 10+ years of experience in the information technology and computer science sector. I'm currently interested in software engineering (specifically security/SRE/DevOps) and product management opportunities via remote or within the SF Bay Area.

<br><br>
I've taken an interest in creating products that make people's lives easier, whether that means managing a team or building it with my own hands. If I'm not drafting some crazy new venture I had or coding a random project, you can find me playing games, trying new foods, or going crazy at the gym.
