<div class = "heading"> <h2>About Me</h2>

<br>
I'm a part of UC Berkeley's Class of 2025, studying Data Science with an emphasis in Business Analytics, and am currently interested in software engineering (specifically security/SRE/DevOps) and product management.

<br>
I've taken an interest in creating products that make people's lives easier, whether that means managing a team or building it with my own hands. If I'm not drafting some crazy new venture I had or coding a random project, you can find me playing games, trying new foods, or going crazy at the gym.
