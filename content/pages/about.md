# Hey, I'm Matt!

â€”

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I'm currently a sophomore at Alhambra High School; the leader of 3 Ways to Heck, an organization dedicated toward the act of spreading cyber security to the common people; and owner of Valkyrie PCs, an IT company formed towards the recent climb in PC gaming. I originally started this as a project to familiarize myself as a front end dev with Reactjs, HTML, and CSS but has since transformed to my blog, portfolio, and about any other use for a personal website.
