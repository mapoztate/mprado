# Hey, I'm Matt!

â€”

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I'm a junior at Alhambra High School with experience in information technology, computer science, and financial services. From drafting business plans to leading cybersecurity camps for students, you can rely on me to adapt to any situation. I'm seeking to work or research in the fields of business, medicine, and computer science, whether it be via telecommute or in the vicinity of the Bay Area. You can find all of my work right here!
