<div class = "heading"> <h2>About Me</h2>
<h4>Currently enrolled in full-time high school and community college studies, majoring in Economics and Business. <h4> </div>

<br>
I'm a third year student at Alhambra Senior High, and a second year student at Diablo Valley College with the intention of applying to a 4 year college after high school graduation. I've taken an interest in creating products that make people's lives easier, whether that means managing a team or building it with my own hands.
  
If I'm not drafting some crazy new venture I had or coding a random project, you can find me playing games, trying new foods, or going crazy at the gym.
