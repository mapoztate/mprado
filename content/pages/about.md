<div class = "heading"> <h2>About Me</h2>

<br>

Currently triple majoring in Data Science, Environmental Economics & Policy, and South & Southeast Asian Studies at UC Berkeley. I'm exploring adjacent topics in data engineering including security, virtualization, and product, with research interests in computational social science (i.e. privacy/algorithmic disgorgement, socioeconomics) and computer science pedagogy. Please refer to my LinkedIn/CV for more information regarding my professional/academic experience.
