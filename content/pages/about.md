<div class = "heading"> <h2>About Me</h2>
<h4>Currently enrolled in full-time high school and community college studies.<h4> </div>

<br>
I'm a fourth year student at Alhambra Senior High, and a graduate of Economics & Business at Diablo Valley College. I plan on majoring in Computer Science or a related field, and am currently seeking opportunities. I intend on applying to a 4 year college after high school graduation. 

I've taken an interest in creating products that make people's lives easier, whether that means managing a team or building it with my own hands.If I'm not drafting some crazy new venture I had or coding a random project, you can find me playing games, trying new foods, or going crazy at the gym.
